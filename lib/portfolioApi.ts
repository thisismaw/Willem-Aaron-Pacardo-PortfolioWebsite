    fullDescription: "The client, 'The Sweet Spot Bakery', approached me with an outdated website that wasn&apos;t mobile-friendly and lacked any e-commerce capabilities. Their primary goal was to increase online visibility and allow customers to place orders directly through the site. \n\nI developed a fully custom, responsive WordPress theme from scratch, focusing on a clean, appetizing design that reflected their brand. Key features included an intuitive online ordering system integrated with WooCommerce, optimized product pages with high-quality imagery, and a streamlined checkout process. Local SEO best practices were implemented throughout the site. \n\nPost-launch, the bakery saw a 30% increase in online orders within the first two months and a significant improvement in their local search engine rankings, often appearing in the top 3 results for relevant keywords. The bounce rate also decreased by 50%, indicating a much-improved user experience.",

We utilized A/B testing for ad creatives and continuously refined our approach based on data. \n\nThe campaign successfully surpassed all key performance indicators. We achieved a 150% increase in overall engagement (likes, shares, comments) compared to previous benchmarks and generated a 70% growth in qualified leads through targeted landing pages. The client was extremely pleased with the ROI and brand visibility achieved.",

I worked closely with their subject matter experts to review scripts and storyboards. \n\nUsing CapCut for initial edits and mobile-friendly aspects, and DaVinci Resolve for more advanced color grading and effects, I produced the full series. This included sourcing appropriate B-roll footage and stock animations, creating custom motion graphics for titles and callouts, and ensuring consistent branding across all videos. \n\nThe videos have received excellent feedback from students for their clarity and engaging style, contributing to higher course completion rates.",

I designed and implemented a comprehensive 'Startup OS' within Notion. \n\nThis involved creating interconnected databases for projects, tasks (with assignments, deadlines, and progress tracking), a client CRM, a content calendar, and a company wiki for SOPs and resources. Custom dashboards were built for different team roles, providing personalized views of relevant information. \n\nThe new Notion system led to a significant improvement in team productivity, with an estimated 10+ hours saved per week collectively on project management and information retrieval. It also fostered better collaboration and transparency across the organization.",
