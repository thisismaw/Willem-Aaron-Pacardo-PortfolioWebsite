    fullDescription: "The client, 'The Sweet Spot Bakery', approached me with an outdated website that wasn't mobile-friendly and lacked any e-commerce capabilities. Their primary goal was to increase online visibility and allow customers to place orders directly through the site. \n\nI developed a fully custom, responsive WordPress theme from scratch, focusing on a clean, appetizing design that reflected their brand. Key features included an intuitive online ordering system integrated with WooCommerce, optimized product pages with high-quality imagery, and a streamlined checkout process. Local SEO best practices were implemented throughout the site. \n\nPost-launch, the bakery saw a 30% increase in online orders within the first two months and a significant improvement in their local search engine rankings, often appearing in the top 3 results for relevant keywords. The bounce rate also decreased by 50%, indicating a much-improved user experience.",

We utilized A/B testing for ad creatives and continuously refined our approach based on data. \n\nThe campaign successfully surpassed all key performance indicators. We achieved a 150% increase in overall engagement (likes, shares, comments) compared to previous benchmarks and generated a 70% growth in qualified leads through targeted landing pages.

This included sourcing appropriate B-roll footage and stock animations, creating custom motion graphics for titles and callouts, and ensuring consistent branding across all videos. \n\nThe videos have received excellent feedback from students for their clarity and engaging style, contributing to higher course completion rates.",

Custom dashboards were built for different team roles, providing personalized views of relevant information. \n\nThe new Notion system led to a significant improvement in team productivity, with an estimated 10+ hours saved per week collectively on project management and information retrieval.
